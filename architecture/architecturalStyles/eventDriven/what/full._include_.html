    <p>An event is a notable occurrence that happens inside or outside the software, such as the user clicking a button, a timer running out, minimizing a window, etc. In the event-driven architectural style, events are detected and communicated to the affected
      components. These components then react to the events, if required. For example, when the ‘button clicked’ event occurs, functions that are tied to the button-click event is activated. This architectural style is often used in GUIs.</p>
