The _service-oriented architecture_ (SOA) is a relatively recent architectural style for distributed applications. An SOA is essentially an application built by combining functionalities packaged as **programmatically accessible services**. A prerequisite for SOA is the interoperability between distributed services, which may not even be implemented using the same programming language. A common way to implement SOAs is through the use of _XML web services_ where the web is used as the medium for the services to interact, and XML is used as the language of communication between service providers and service users.

Example:

Suppose that Amazon.com provides a web service for customers to browse and buy merchandize, while HSBC provides a web service for merchants to charge HSBC credit cards. Using these web services, an ‘eBookShop’ web application can be developed that allows HSBC customers to buy merchandize from Amazon and pay for them using HSBC credit cards. Since both Amazon and HSBC services follow the SOA architecture, their web services can be reused by the web application, even if all three systems use different programming platforms.
