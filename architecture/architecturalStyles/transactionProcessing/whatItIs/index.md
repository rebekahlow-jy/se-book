#### What it is :one:

<div id="main">

The main characteristic of a transaction processing architecture style is that the workload of the system is broken down to a number of _transactions_. These transactions are then given to a “dispatcher” that controls the execution of each transaction. Task queuing, ordering, “undo” etc. are handled by the dispatcher.
