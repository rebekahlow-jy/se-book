- [ ] a. Refactoring can improve understandability

- [x] e. Refactoring can do all of the above

Explanation: Although the primary aim of refactoring is to improve internal code structure, it in turn can unearth bugs (when the code structure becomes better, hidden bugs become easier to spot) and even improve performance (sometimes, simpler code runs faster than complex code because simpler code is easier for the compiler to optimize).
