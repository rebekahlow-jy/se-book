Do you agree with the following statement? Justify your answer.

Statement: Whenever we refactor code to fix bugs, we need not do regression testing if the bug fix was minor.

<div slot="answer">

DISAGREE.

1. Even a minor change can have major repercussions on the system. We MUST do regression testing after each change, no matter how minor it is.
2. Fixing bugs is technically not refactoring.
