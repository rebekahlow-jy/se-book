Whether a refactoring improves the code or degrades it depends on the situation.  That is why some refactorings are ‘opposites’ of each other (e.g. _extract method vs inline method_).

It is important to refactor frequently so as to avoid the accumulation of ‘messy’ code which might get out of control.

How much refactoring is too much refactoring? It is too much refactoring when the benefits no longer justify the cost. The costs and the benefits depend on the context.
