**Lines should be no longer than 110 (soft limit) - 120 chars (hard limit).**

Place the line breaks to improve readability. It is ok to exceed 110 char limit for a line, but not by too much. You can configure Eclipse to break lines after 110 chars, but sometimes the automatic line break does not give readability. In such cases, you can decide where to put the line break to have best readability.
