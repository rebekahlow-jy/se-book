      <p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is a process improvement approach defined by Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon University. CMMI provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes, which will improve
        their performance. CMMI-based process improvement includes identifying an organization‚Äôs process strengths and weaknesses and making process changes to turn weaknesses into strengths.</p>

    <p>CMMI defines five maturity levels for a process and provides criteria to determine if the process of an organization is at a certain maturity level. The diagram below [taken from Wikipedia] gives an overview of the five levels.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/more/cmmi/images/diagram.png"
