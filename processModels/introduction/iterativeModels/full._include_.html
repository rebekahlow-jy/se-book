    <p>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC. Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement gathering to
      testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/introduction/iterativeModels/images/diagram.png" height="300">
    <p></p>
    <p>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product. Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the
      early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
    <p>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>breadth-first: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
      <li>depth-first: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The breadth-first approach is considered purely ‘iterative’, while depth-first is ‘incremental’. As mentioned before, most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations. Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>
