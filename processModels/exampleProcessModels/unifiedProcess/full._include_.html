    <p>The <em>unified process</em> is developed by the Three Amigos - Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh (the creators of UML).</p>
    <p>The unified process consists of four phases: <em>inception, elaboration, construction and transition</em>. The main purpose of each phase can be summarized as follows:</p>

    <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled “I1” “E1”, “E2”, “C1”, etc.) represents a single iteration.
      Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‘workflows’ such as ‘Business modeling’, ‘Requirements’, ‘Analysis &amp; Design’ etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular iteration.</p>
    <p>Note that the unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process. For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in a given
      iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develope a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more helpful. Therefore,
      the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>
