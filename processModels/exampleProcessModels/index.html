              <p>The first Extreme Programming project was started March 6, 1996. Extreme Programming is one of several popular Agile Processes. Extreme Programming (XP) stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly
                want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it. XP aims to empower developers to confidently respond to changing customer requirements, even late in the life cycle.</p>
              <p>XP emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. XP implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the
                problem to solve it as efficiently as possible.</p>
              <p>XP aims to improve a software project in five essential ways: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. Extreme Programmers constantly communicate with their customers and fellow programmers. They keep their design simple
                and clean. They get feedback by testing their software starting on day one. Every small success deepens their respect for the unique contributions of each and every team member. With this foundation, Extreme Programmers are able to courageously
                respond to changing requirements and technology.</p>
              <p>XP has a set of simple rules. XP is a lot like a jig saw puzzle with many small pieces. Individually the pieces make no sense, but when combined together a complete picture can be seen. This flow chart shows how Extreme Programming's rules
                work together.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/xp/images/diagram.png" height="200">

            <p>This description of Scrum was adapted from Wikipedia [retrieved on 18/10/2011]:</p>
            <tip-box>
              Scrum is a process skeleton that contains sets of practices and predefined roles. The main roles in Scrum are:
              <ul>
                <li>The ScrumMaster, who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)</li>
                <li>The Product Owner, who represents the stakeholders and the business</li>
                <li>The Team, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A Scrum project is divided into iterations called Sprints. A sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. Sprints tend to last between one week and one month, and are a timeboxed (i.e. restricted to a specific duration) effort of a
                constant length.</p>
              <p>Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting, where the progress is reviewed and lessons
                for the next sprint are identified.</p>
              <p>During each sprint, the team creates a potentially deliverable product increment (for example, working and tested software). The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high level
                requirements of work to be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the Product Owner informs the team of the items in the product backlog that he or she wants
                completed. The team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during the next sprint, and records this in the sprint backlog. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, which means that the requirements
                are frozen for that sprint. Development is timeboxed such that the sprint must end on time; if requirements are not completed for any reason they are left out and returned to the product backlog. After a sprint is completed, the team demonstrates
                the use of the software.</p>
              <p>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
              <p>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional
                predictive or planned manner. As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach‚Äîaccepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team‚Äôs ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p>
              <p>Like other agile development methodologies, Scrum can be implemented through a wide range of tools. Many companies use universal software tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also
                open-source and proprietary software packages dedicated to management of products under the Scrum process. Other organizations implement Scrum without the use of any software tools, and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such
                as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes. The diagram below illustrates the essence of the Scrum process.</p><img src="/se-book/processModels/exampleProcessModels/scrum/images/diagram.png" height="250">

            <p>Given above is a visualization of a project done using the Unified process (source: Wikipedia). As the diagram shows, a phase can consist of several iterations. Each vertical column (labeled ‚ÄúI1‚Äù ‚ÄúE1‚Äù, ‚ÄúE2‚Äù, ‚ÄúC1‚Äù, etc.) represents a single
              iteration. Each of the iterations consists of a set of ‚Äòworkflows‚Äô such as ‚ÄòBusiness modeling‚Äô, ‚ÄòRequirements‚Äô, ‚ÄòAnalysis & Design‚Äô etc. The shaded region indicates the amount of resource and effort spent on a particular workflow in a particular
              iteration.</p>
            <p>Note that the unified process is a flexible and customizable process model framework rather than a single fixed process. For example, the number of iterations in each phase, definition of workflows, and the intensity of a given workflow in
              a given iteration can be adjusted according to the nature of the project. Take the Construction Phase, to develope a simple system, one or two iterations would be sufficient. For a more complicated system, multiple iterations will be more
              helpful. Therefore, the diagram above simply records a particular application of the UP rather than prescribe how the UP is to be applied. However, this record can be refined and reused for similar future projects.</p>
