        <p>Object Oriented Programming is a widely used programming paradigm. Here is an introductory explanation of OOP from Apple:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts‚Äîdata and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state
            of their own; they‚Äôre useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
          <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it‚Äôs not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background
            against which we work. At some point, all programmers‚Äîeven object-oriented programmers‚Äîmust lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
          <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that‚Äôs about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won‚Äôt divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are
            the basic elements of design.</p>
          <p>Object-oriented programming doesn‚Äôt so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete
            program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>
