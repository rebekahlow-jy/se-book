Object Oriented Programming is a widely used programming paradigm. Here is an introductory explanation of OOP from Apple:

> Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data.
> Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that
> operate on data have no lasting state of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.
>
> This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore
> or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs,
> it forms the background against which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must
> lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.
>
> With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various
> kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and
> data structures are the basic elements of design.
>
> Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level.
> It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks
> to form a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.
