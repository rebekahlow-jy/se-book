#### Objects as Abstraction :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

The concept of Object in OOP is an abstraction mechanism because it allows us to abstract away the lower level details (i.e. data and the methods) and work with bigger granularity entities (i.e. objects).

Example:

We can deal with Adam object instead of details such as Adamâ€™s date of birth (DoB), in what format the DoB is stored, the algorithm used to calculate the age from the DoB.
