    <p>Overridden operations are <strong>resolved at runtime</strong>. That is, the runtime decides which version of the operation should be executed based on the actual type of the receiving object. This is also called <em>dynamic binding</em> (sometimes
      called <em>late binding</em> and <em>run-time binding</em>). Most OO languages support dynamic binding.</p>
    <tip-box type="info">
      <p>There are subtle differences between late binding and dynamic binding, but they are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <tip-box>
      <p>Example:</p><img src="/se-book/oopDesign/inheritance/dynamicAndStaticBinding/images/staff.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
      <pre class="hljs"><code>void adjustSalary(int byPercent) {
    for (Staff s: staff) {
        s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>The <strong>declared</strong> type of s is <code>Staff</code> and it appears as if the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of the <code>Staff</code> class is invoked. However, at runtime the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of the actual
        object will be called (i.e. <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of Admin or Academic). If the actual object does not override that operation, the operation defined in the immediate superclass (in this case, Staff class) will be called.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>In contrast, overloaded methods are resolved at compile time, also called <em>static binding</em> (also called <em>early binding</em> and <em>compile-time binding</em>.)</p>
    <tip-box>
      <pre class="hljs"><code>class Account {
    Account () {
        // Signature: ()
        ...
    }
    Account (String name, String number, double balance) {
        // Signature: (String, String, double)
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <pre class="hljs"><code>void calculateCAP (String matric) { ... }
void calculateCAP (int[] averages) { ... }
</code></pre>
      <p>The calls to the two constructors are resolved at compile time.</p>
