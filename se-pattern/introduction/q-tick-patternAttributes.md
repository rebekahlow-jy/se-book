- [ ] They are commonly used solutions
- [ ] They are are found in the <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:gofbook">GoF book</trigger>
 

<div slot="hint">

This is not strictly accurate:

- [ ] They are recurring ==problems==<br>
  %%{Reason: Design patterns are _solutions_, not _problems_}%% 

</div>

<div slot="answer">

None of these are strictly accurate.

- [ ] They are recurring ==problems==<br>
  %%{Reason: Design patterns are _solutions_, not _problems_}%% 
- [ ] They are ==commonly== used solutions<br> 
  %%{Reason: Just because something is used a lot does not qualify it as a design pattern. To be considered a design pattern, it should be a good solution}%%
- [ ] They are found ==in the GoF book==<br>
  %%{Reason: While the GoF book contains design patterns, it does not mean only those in the GoF book are considered design patterns}%%
