<Question has-input>

Assume that you are implementing a class called `PassKey` that can have only three instances at any time. These instances are to be called `entryPassKey`, `exitPassKey` and `lockPassKey`. They are to be created at system startup. All three instances are immutable (i.e. once created, cannot be changed). As you know, Singleton pattern can limit the number of instances to only one. Explain how you will extend the idea behind the Singleton pattern to implement the `Passkey` class. Show code examples where necessary.

There are other acceptable variations.

```java
class PassKey {
    private static PassKey entryPassKey = new PassKey(); // this way, the object is created as system startup.
    private static PassKey exitPassKey = new PassKey();
    private static PassKey lockPassKey = new PassKey();
    private void PassKey(){...} // private constructor

    public static PassKey getEntryPassKey() {
        return entryPassKey;
    }
    // getExitPassKey() and getLockPassKey() are similar.
}
```
