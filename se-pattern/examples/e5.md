With respect to the general form of the Observer pattern given above, when the `Observable` object invokes the `notifyObservers()` method, it is treating all `ConcreteObserver` objects as a general type called `Observer` and calling the `update()` method of each of them. However, the `update()` method of each `ConcreteObserver` could potentially show different behavior based on its actual type. That is, `update()` method shows polymorphic behavior.

In the example give below, the notifyUIs operation can result in `StudentListUi` and `StudentStatsUi` changing their views in two different ways.
