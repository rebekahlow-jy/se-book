The common format to describe a pattern consists of the following components: 
* **Context**: The situation or scenario where the design problem is encountered.
* **Problem**: The main difficulty to be resolved. The criteria for a good solution are also identified to evaluate solutions.
* **Solution**: The core of the solution. It is important to note that the solution presented only includes the most general constraints, which may need further refinement for a specific context.
* **Anti-patterns** (optional): Commonly used solutions, which are usually incorrect and/or inferior to the Design Pattern.
* **Consequences** (optional): Identifying the pros and cons of applying the pattern.
* **Other useful information** (optional): Code examples, known uses, other related patterns, etc.
