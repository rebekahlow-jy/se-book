If a subclass imposes more restrictive conditions than its parent class, it violates Liskov substitution principle.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [x] a. True
- [ ] b. False

Explanation: If the subclass is more restrictive than the parent class, a piece of code that worked with the parent class may not work with the child class. Hence, the substitutability does not exist and Liskov substitution principle is violated.
