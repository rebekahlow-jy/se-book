- [ ] a. WHAT the code does
- [ ] b. WHY the code does something
- [x] c. HOW the code does something

Explanation: How the code does something should be apparent from the code itself. However, comments can help the reader in describing WHAT and WHY aspects of the code. This was discussed during the lecture.
