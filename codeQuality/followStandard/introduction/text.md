A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is commonly used in the industry. Doing so will make it easier for others to work with your code, be they members from the same team or transferred from another team/company. IDEs can help to enforce some parts of a coding standard e.g. indentation rules.
