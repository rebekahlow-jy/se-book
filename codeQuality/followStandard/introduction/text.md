**One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow follow a strict coding standard (aka _style guide_).**

**The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person**. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally consistent with typical industry practices. Doing so will make it easier for others to work with your code, be they members from the same team or transferred from another team/company.

IDEs can help to enforce some parts of a coding standard e.g. indentation rules.
