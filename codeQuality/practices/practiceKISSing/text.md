#### Practice KISSing

</div>

<div id="body">

As the old adage goes, "keep it simple, stupid” (KISS).  Do not try to write ‘clever’ code. For example, do not dismiss the brute-force yet simple solution in favor of a complicated one because of some ‘supposed benefits’ such as faster performance or better reuse unless you have a strong justification.

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.
