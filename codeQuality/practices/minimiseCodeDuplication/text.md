#### Minimise Code Duplication

</div>

<div id="body">

The book "[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)" calls this the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Code duplication, especially when you copy-paste-modify code, often indicates a poor quality implementation. While it may not be possible to have zero duplication, always think twice before duplicating code; most often there is a better alternative.
