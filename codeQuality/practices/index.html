        <p>When the code has a number that does not explain the meaning of the number, we call that a magic number (as in “the number appears as if by magic”).</p>
        <tip-box>

        <p>As you can see, using a named constant makes the code easier to understand because the name tells us more about the meaning of the number. Similarly, we can have ‘magic’ values of other data types.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Make the code as explicit as possible, even if the language syntax allows them to be implicit. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use explicit type conversion instead of implicit type conversion.</li>
          <li>Use parentheses/braces to show grouping even when they can be skipped.</li>
          <li>Use enumerations when a certain variable can take only a small number of finite values. For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled', and 'disabled' respectively,
            declare 'state' as type <code>SystemState</code> and define an enumeration <code>SystemState</code> that has values <code>'STARTING'</code>, <code>'ENABLED'</code>, and <code>'DISABLED'</code>.</li>
          <li>When statements should follow a particular order, try to make it obvious (with appropriate naming, or at least comments). For example, if you name two functions <code>'taskA()'</code> and <code>'taskB()'</code>, it is not obvious which one should
            be called first. Contrast this with naming the functions <code>'phaseOne()'</code> and <code>'phaseTwo()'</code> instead. This is especially important when statements in one function must be called before the other one.</li>

    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Lay out the code so that it adheres to the logical structure. The code should read like a story. Just like we use section breaks, chapters and paragraphs to organize a story, use classes, methods, indentation and line spacing in your code to group
          related segments of the code. For example, you can use blank lines to group related statements together. Sometimes, the correctness of your code does not depend on the order in which you perform certain intermediary steps. Nevertheless, this
          order may affect the clarity of the story you are trying to tell. Choose the order that makes the story most readable.</p>

        <p>Avoid varying the level of abstraction within a code fragment. Note: The <em>Productive Programmer</em> (by Neal Ford) calls this the <em>SLAP principle</em> i.e. Single Level of Abstraction Per method.</p>
        <tip-box>

            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong>:</p>
            <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
              that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand. For example, within a certain software component, we might deal with a ‘user’ data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item. These details have been
              ‘abstracted away’ as they do not affect the task of that software component. This is called <em>data abstraction</em>. On the other hand, <em>control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks at
              a simplified level. For example, <code>print(“Hello”)</code> is an abstraction of the actual output mechanism within the computer.</p>
            <p>Abstraction can be applied repeatedly to obtain higher and <em>higher levels of abstractions</em>. For example, a <code>File</code> is a data item that is at a higher level than an array and an array is at a higher level than a bit. Similarly,
              <code>execute(Game)</code> is at a higher level than <code>print(Char)</code> which is at a higher than an Assembly language instruction <code>MOV</code>.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unintended. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that should be indented. Someone reading the
          code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

        <p>We all get into situations where we need to write some code momentarily that we intend to dispose of replace with better code later. Such code should be marked in some obvious way (e.g. using an embarrassing print message) so that you will not
          forget to remove them later. It is irresponsible to retain such code in a product release.</p>

        <p>Do not write comments as if they are private notes to self. Instead, write them well enough to be understood by another programmer. One type of comments that is almost always useful is the <em>header comment</em> that you write for a file, class,
          or an operation to explain its purpose.</p>

        <p>When you write comments, use them to explain <em>why</em> and <em>what</em> aspect of the code, rather than the <em>how</em> aspect. The former is usually not apparent in the code and writing it down adds value to the code. The latter should already
          be apparent from the code.</p>
