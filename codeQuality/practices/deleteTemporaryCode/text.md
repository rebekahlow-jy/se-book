#### Delete Temporary Code

</div>

<div id="body">

We all get into situations where we need to write some code momentarily that we intend to dispose of replace with better code later. Such code should be marked in some obvious way (e.g. using an embarrassing print message) so that you will not forget to remove them later. It is irresponsible to retain such code in a product release.
