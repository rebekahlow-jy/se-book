**Quality Assurance = Validation + Verification**

QA involves checking two aspects:

1. Building the right system, i.e. are the requirements correct? This is called _validation_.
2. Building the system right, i.e. are the requirements implemented correctly? This is called _verification_.

Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is both are done, instead of limiting to verification (i.e., remember that the requirements can be wrong too).
