Code review is the systematic examination code with the intention of finding where the code can be improved.

Reviews can be done in various forms. Some examples below:

* **In pair programming**

  * As pair programming involves two programmers working on the same code at the same time, there is an implicit review of the code by the other member of the pair.

* **Pull Request reviews**

  * Tools such as GitHub and BitBucket allows the new code to be proposed as Pull Requests and provides the ability for others to review the code in the PR.

* **Formal inspections**

  * Inspections involve a group of people systematically examining a project artefact to discover defects. Members of the inspection team play various roles during the process, such as:

    * the author - the creator of the artefact
    * the moderator - the planner and executer of the inspection meeting
    * the secretary - the recorder of the findings of the inspection
    * the inspector/reviewer - the one who inspects/reviews the artefact.

Advantages:

* It can detect functionality defects as well as other problems such as coding standard violations.
* Can verify non-code artefacts and incomplete code
* Do not require test drivers or stubs.

Disadvantages:

* It is a manual process and therefore, error prone.
