Testing cannot prove the absence of errors. It can only prove the presence of errors. However, formal methods can prove the absence of errors.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [x] a. True
- [ ] b. False

Explanation: While using formal methods is more expensive than testing, it indeed can prove the correctness of a piece of software conclusively, in certain contexts. Getting such proof via testing requires exhaustive testing, which is not practical to do in most cases.
