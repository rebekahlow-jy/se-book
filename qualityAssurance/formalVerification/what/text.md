Formal verification uses mathematical techniques to prove the correctness of a program.

Advantages:

* Formal verification can be used to prove the absence of errors. In contrast, testing can only prove the presence of error, not the absence.

Disadvantages:

* It only proves the compliance with the specification, but not the actual utility of the software.
* It requires highly specialized notations and knowledge which makes it an expensive technique to administer.

Therefore, formal verifications are more commonly used in safety-critical software such as flight control systems.
