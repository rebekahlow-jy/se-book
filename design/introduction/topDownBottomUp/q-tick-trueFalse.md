Top-down design is better than bottom-up design.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [ ] a. True
- [x] b. False

Explanation: Not necessarily. It depends on the situation. Bottom-up design may be preferable when there are lot of existing components we want to reuse. In CS2103, we enforce top-down design because beginner programmers only know bottom-up design which is not suitable in many situations.
