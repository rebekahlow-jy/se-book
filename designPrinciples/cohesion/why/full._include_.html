    <p>The following are some disadvantages of low cohesion (or “weak cohesion”).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Impedes the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
      <li>Difficulty in maintaining modules because a localized adjustment in the requirements can result in changes spread across the system since requirement-related functionality is implemented across many components of the system.</li>
      <li>Modules become less reusable because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One should strive for high cohesion to facilitate code maintenance and reuse.</p>
