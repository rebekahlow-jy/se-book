<div id="body">

The following are some disadvantages of low cohesion (or “weak cohesion”).

*	Impedes the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.
*	Difficulty in maintaining modules because a localized adjustment in the requirements can result in changes spread across the system since requirement-related functionality is implemented across many components of the system.
*	Modules become less reusable because they do not represent logical units of functionality.

One should strive for high cohesion to facilitate code maintenance and reuse.
