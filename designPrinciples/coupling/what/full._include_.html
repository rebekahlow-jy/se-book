    <p><em>Coupling</em> is a measure of the degree of <em>dependence</em> between components, classes, methods, etc. Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. In the example below, design A appears to have a more coupling
      between the components than design B.</p>

                <p>Overall coupling levels in <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> seem to be similar (neither has more dependencies than the other). (Note that the number of dependency links is not a definitive measure of the level of coupling. Some links may be stronger
                  than the others.). However, in <em>x</em>, A is highly-coupled to the rest of the system while <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>E</em> are standalone (do not depend on anything else). In <em>y</em>, no component is as highly-coupled
                  as <em>A</em> of <em>x</em>. However, only <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> are standalone.</p>
