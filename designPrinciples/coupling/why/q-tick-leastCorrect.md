Choose the least correct statement.

- [ ] a. As coupling increases, testability decreases.
- [ ] b. As coupling increases, the risk of regression increases.
- [ ] c. As coupling increases, the value of automated regression testing increases.
- [ ] d. As coupling increases, integration becomes easier as everything is connected together.
- [ ] e. As coupling increases, maintainability decreases.

- [ ] b. As coupling increases, the risk of regression increases.
- [ ] c. As coupling increases, the value of automated regression testing increases.
- [x] d. As coupling increases, integration becomes easier as everything is connected together.
- [ ] e. As coupling increases, maintainability decreases.

Explanation: High coupling means either more components require to be integrated at once in a big-bang fashion (increasing the risk of things going wrong) or more drivers and stubs are required when integrating incrementally.
