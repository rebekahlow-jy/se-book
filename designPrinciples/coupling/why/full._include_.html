    <p>Highly coupled (also referred to as tightly coupled or strongly coupled) systems display the following disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A change in one module usually forces changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
      <li>Integration is harder because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>
      <li>Testing and reuse of the module is harder due to its dependence on other modules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the case of high-coupling (i.e. relatively high dependency), a change in one component may require changes in other coupled components. Therefore, we should strive to achieve a low-coupled design.</p>

              <div slot="answer">
                <p>When the system is highly-coupled, the risk of regression is higher too. When component A is modified, all components ‘coupled’ to component A risk ‘unintended behavioral changes’.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Explanation: High coupling means either more components require to be integrated at once in a big-bang fashion (increasing the risk of things going wrong) or more drivers and stubs are required when integrating incrementally.</p>
