The Observer pattern can be used when we want one object to initiate an activity in another object without having a direct dependency from the first object to the second object.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [x] a. True
- [ ] b. False

Explanation: Yes. For example, when applying the Observer pattern to an MVC structure, Views can get notified and update themselves about a change to the Model without the Model having to depend on the Views.
