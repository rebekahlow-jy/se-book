In software development, there are certain problems that recur in a certain context.

Examples:

| Design Context                                                                                        | Recurring Problem                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assembling a system that makes use of other existing systems implemented using different technologies | What is the best architecture?                                                                |
| UI needs to be updated when the data in application backend changes                                   | How to initiate an update to the UI when data changes without coupling the backend to the UI? |

After repeated attempts at solving such problems, better solutions are discovered and refined over time. These solutions are known as design patterns, a term popularized by the seminal book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by the so-called “Gang of Four” (GoF) Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.
