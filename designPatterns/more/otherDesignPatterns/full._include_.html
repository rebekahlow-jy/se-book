    <p>However, most are common, and well known. As an example, GoF book contains 23 design patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creational</strong>: About object creation. They separate the operation of an application from how its objects are created.
        <ul>
          <li>Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Structural</strong>: About the composition of objects into larger structures while catering for future extension in structure.
        <ul>
          <li>Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight, Proxy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: Defining how objects interact and how responsibility is distributed among them.
        <ul>
          <li>Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Template Method, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
