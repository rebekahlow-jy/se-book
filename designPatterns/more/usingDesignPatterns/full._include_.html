    <p>{patterns provide a vocabulary}</p>
    <p>The more patterns one acquires, the more ‘experienced’ she is. Exposing oneself to a multitude of patterns (at least the context and problem) is a must. Some patterns are domain-specific (e.g. patterns for distributed applications), some are created
      in-house (e.g. patterns in the company/project) and some can be self-created (e.g. from past experience).</p>
    <p>When using patterns, be careful not to overuse them. Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before
      applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
      <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>
    </ul>
