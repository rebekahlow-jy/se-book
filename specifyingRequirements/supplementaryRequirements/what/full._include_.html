    <p>Examples of requirements typically found under this heading include:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <ul>
        <li>Business/domain rules: e.g. the size of the minefield cannot be smaller than five.</li>
        <li>Constraints: e.g. the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
        <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
        <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
        <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
        <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
        <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
        <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.</li>
