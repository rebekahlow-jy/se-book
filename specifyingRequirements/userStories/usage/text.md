**User stories capture user requirements in a way that is convenient for** <popover content="i.e. which features to include in the product">scoping</popover>, <popover content="i.e. how much effort each feature will take">estimation</popover> and <popover content="i.e. when to deliver each feature">scheduling</popover>.

> [User stories] strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.<br/>

**User stories differ** from <popover content="e.g. a description of the requirements written in prose">traditional requirements specifications</popover> mainly in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough details to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the user story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the user story, the developers will meet with the customer face-to-face  to work out a more detailed description of the requirements. %%[<trigger for="modal:xp-user-stories" trigger="click">:bookmark:</trigger>]%%

**User stories can capture non-functional requirements too** because even NFRs must benefit some stakeholder.

<include src="../../../common/popOvers.md#xp" inline /> uses User stories to capture requirements.

[This page](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html) in their website explains the difference between user stories and traditional requirements.

>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.
