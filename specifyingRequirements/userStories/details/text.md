**The `{benefit}` can be omitted** if it is obvious.

<tip-box>

As a user, I can login to the system ~~so that I can access my data~~

</tip-box>

<tip-box type="warning">

It is recommended to confirm there is a concrete benefit even if you omit it from the user story. If not, we could end up adding features that have no real benefit.

</tip-box>

We can add more characteristics to the `{user role}` to provide more context to the user story.

<tip-box>

* As a ==forgetful== user, I can view a password hint, so that I can recall my password.
* As an ==expert== user, I can tweak the underlying formatting tags of the document, so that I can format the document exactly as I need.

</tip-box>

**We can write user stories at various levels**. High-level user stories, called _**epics**_ (or _themes_) cover bigger functionality. We can then break down these epics to multiple user stories of normal size.

<tip-box>

[Epic] As a lecturer, I can monitor student participation levels
  * As a lecturer, I can view the forum post count of each student
    so that I can identify the activity level of students in the forum
  * As a lecturer, I can view webcast view records of each student
    so that I can identify the students who did not view webcasts
  * As a lecturer, I can view file download statistics of each student
    so that I can identify the students who do not download lecture materials

</tip-box>

**We can add _conditions of satisfaction_ to a user story** to specify things that need to be true for the user story implementation to be accepted as ‘done’.

<tip-box>

* As a lecturer, I can view the forum post count of each student so that I can identify the activity level of students in the forum.<br/>
  Conditions:<br/>
  [ ] Separate post count for each forum should be shown<br/>
  [ ] Total post count of a student should be shown<br/>
  [ ] The list should be sortable by student name and post count

</tip-box>

**Other useful info that can be added to a user story** includes (but not limited to)

* Priority: how important the user story is
* Size: the estimated effort to implement the user story
* Urgency: how soon the feature is needed
