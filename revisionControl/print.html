        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number,
            each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
          <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single
            user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools
            have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
          <p>There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project. It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of who
            made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
          <p>When you're working with other people, <strong>revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong>. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help you
            to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
          <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you to
            efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
          <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or with
            a hundred other people.</p>

        <p>It follows from the explanation above that using an RCS frees us from having to keep copies of all the past versions on our hard disk. If the RCS spans multiple machines, it also <strong>reduces the risk of ‚Äòlosing everything‚Äô in case of a hard disk crash</strong>.</p>

        <p>Revision control is a diverse field, so much so that it is referred to by many names and acronyms. Here are a few of the more common variations you'll encounter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Revision control system (RCS)</li>
          <li>Software configuration management (SCM), or configuration management</li>
          <li>Source code management</li>
          <li>Source code control, or source control</li>
          <li>Version control system (VCS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some people claim that these terms actually have different meanings, but in practice they overlap so much that there's no agreed or even useful way to tease them apart.</p>

        <p>Suppose you want to apply revision control on files in a directory called <code>ProjectFoo</code>. In that case you need to set up a <em>repo</em> (short for repository) in <code>ProjectFoo</code> directory, which is referred to as the <em>working directory</em>          of the repo. The repository is the database where the meta-data about the revision history are stored. For example, Git uses a hidden folder named <code>.git</code> inside the working directory.</p>
        <p>You can have multiple repos in your computer, each repo revision-controlling files of a different working directly, for examples, files of different projects.</p>

        <p>In a repo, we can specify which files to track and which files to ignore. Some files such a temporary log files created during the build/test process should not be revision-controlled.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Committing</em></strong> saves a snapshot of the current state of the tracked files in the revision control history. Such a snapshot is also called a <strong><em>commit</em></strong> (i.e. the noun).</p>
        <p>When we are ready to commit, we should first <strong><em>stage</em></strong> the specific changes we want to commit. This intermediate step allows us to commit only some changes while saving other changes for a later commit.</p>
        <p>Each commit in a repo is a recorded point in the history of the project that is uniquely identified by an auto-generated hash e.g. <code>a16043703f28e5b3dab95915f5c5e5bf4fdc5fc1</code>. We can tag a specific commit with a more easily identifiable
          name e.g. <code>v1.0.2</code></p>

        <p>Remote repositories are copies of a repo that are hosted on remote computers.</p>
        <p>To get a copy of a remote repo on your computer, we can perform a <strong><em>clone</em></strong> operation which recreates a local repo that contains the same version history as the remote repo.</p>
        <p>After cloning a remote repo, we can first add commits to our local repo and then <strong><em>push</em></strong> those commits to the remote repo (provided we have write-access to it)</p>
        <p>Remote repos are often used when multi-persons projects. Suppose someone has pushed some new commits to a remote repo. We can <strong><em>pull</em></strong> those changes which will bring our local repo up-to-date with the remote repo.</p>

        <p>Branching is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel. For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the team keeps working on another branch. Branches
          can be given names e.g. <code>master</code><code>release</code><code>dev</code>. A branch can be <em>merged</em> to another branch. Merging usually result in a new commit that represents the combination of the changes done in the two branches.</p>

        <p>There are two models that can be followed when using an RCS in a team setting: the <em>centralized</em> model and the <em>distributed</em> model.</p>
        <p><strong>Centralized RCS</strong> (CRCS for short): In this model, there is a central remote repo shared by the team. Team members download (‚Äòpull‚Äô) and upload (‚Äòpush‚Äô) changes between their own local repositories and the central repository. Older
          RCS tools such as CVS and SVN support only this model. Note that these older RCS do not support the notion of a local repo. Instead, they force users to do all the versioning with the remote repo.</p>

          height="180"><strong>The centralized RCS approach without any local repos (e.g., CVS, SVN)</strong></pic>
        <p>Distributed RCS (DRCS for short, also known as Decentralized RCS): In this model, there can be multiple remote repos and pulling and pushing can be done among them in arbitrary ways. The workflow can vary differently from team to team. For example,
          every team member can have his/her own remote repository in addition to their own local repository, as shown in below. Git and Mercurial are some prominent RCS tools that support distributed RCS.</p>

        <p>The ‚Äòofficial‚Äô version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the ‚Äòmain repo‚Äô. All team members fork the main repo and clone it to their local computer.</p>
        <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let‚Äôs assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fix the bug in that branch.</li>

          <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
          <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated ‚Äòmaintainer‚Äô of the main repo) merge the PR, which brings Jean‚Äôs code to the main repo.</li>
          <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, syncs their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>
