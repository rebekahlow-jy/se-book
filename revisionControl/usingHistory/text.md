#### Using History :two:

<div id="body">

We can view the history of a project as a series of past commits and also **_diff_** (i.e. to see the differences) between two points in the history.

We can **_checkout_** any commit in the history (i.e. load the state of files as at that commit) to the working directory. Therefore, we can traverse the history of the project simply by checking out the commits we are interested in.
