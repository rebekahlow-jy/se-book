#### Saving History :one:

##### Tracking and Ignoring

**In a repo, we can specify which files to track and which files to ignore.** Some files such a temporary log files created during the build/test process should not be revision-controlled.

##### Staging and Committing 

<tabs> 
  <tab header=":abc:">

**_Committing_ saves a snapshot of the current state of the tracked files in the revision control history. Such a snapshot is also called a _commit_ (i.e. the noun).**

**When we are ready to commit, we should first _stage_ the specific changes we want to commit.** This intermediate step allows us to commit only some changes while saving other changes for a later commit.

##### Identifying Points in History

**Each commit in a repo is a recorded point in the history of the project that is uniquely identified by an auto-generated hash** e.g. `a16043703f28e5b3dab95915f5c5e5bf4fdc5fc1`. 

**We can tag a specific commit with a more easily identifiable name** e.g. `v1.0.2`
