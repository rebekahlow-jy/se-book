#### Saving History :one:

</div>

<div id="body">

In a repo, we can specify which files to track and which files to ignore. Some files such a temporary log files created during the build/test process should not be revision-controlled.

**_Committing_** saves a snapshot of the current state of the tracked files in the revision control history. Such a snapshot is also called a **_commit_** (i.e. the noun).

When we are ready to commit, we should first **_stage_** the specific changes we want to commit. This intermediate step allows us to commit only some changes while saving other changes for a later commit.

Each commit in a repo is a recorded point in the history of the project that is uniquely identified by an auto-generated hash e.g. `a16043703f28e5b3dab95915f5c5e5bf4fdc5fc1`. We can tag a specific commit with a more easily identifiable name e.g. `v1.0.2`
