Revision control is a diverse field, so much so that it is referred to by many names and acronyms. Here are a few of the more common variations you'll encounter:

* Revision control system (RCS)
* Software configuration management (SCM), or configuration management
* Source code management
* Source code control, or source control
* Version control system (VCS)

Some people claim that these terms actually have different meanings, but in practice they overlap so much that there's no agreed or even useful way to tease them apart.
