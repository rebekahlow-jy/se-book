#### Remote Repositories :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

Remote repositories are copies of a repo that are hosted on remote computers.

To get a copy of a remote repo on your computer, we can perform a **_clone_** operation which recreates a local repo that contains the same version history as the remote repo.

After cloning a remote repo, we can first add commits to our local repo and then **_push_** those commits to the remote repo (provided we have write-access to it)

Remote repos are often used when multi-persons projects. Suppose someone has pushed some new commits to a remote repo. We can **_pull_** those changes which will bring our local repo up-to-date with the remote repo.
