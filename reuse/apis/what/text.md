An _Application Programming Interface (API)_ specifies the interface through which other programs can interact with a software component. It is a contract between the component and its clients.

<tip-box>

Example:

The API of the Java String class is given at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html

In this case, the API is a collection of public methods that we can invoke to make use of the String class.

Example:

The GitHub API is given at https://developer.github.com/v3/

In this case the API is a collection of Web request formats GitHub server accepts and the corresponding responses. We can write a program that interacts with GitHub through that API.
