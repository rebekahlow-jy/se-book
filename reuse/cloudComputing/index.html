            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over the network, rather than a product running on a local machine. This means the actual hardware and software is located at a remote location, typically, at a large server farm, while
              users access them over the network. Maintenance of the hardware and software is managed by the cloud provider while users typically pay for only the amount of services they use. This model is similar to the consumption of electricity; the
              power company manages the power plant, while the consumers pay them only for the electricity used. The cloud computing model optimizes hardware and software utilization and reduces the cost to consumers. Furthermore, users can scale up/down
              their utilization at will without having to upgrade their hardware and software. The traditional non-cloud model of computing is similar to everyone buying their own generators to create electricity for their own use.</p>

            <p>Cloud computing can deliver computing services at three levels:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong>: IaaS delivers computer infrastructure as a service. For example, a user can deploy virtual servers on the cloud instead of buying physical hardware and installing server software on
                  them. Another example would be a customer using storage space on the cloud for off-site storage of data. Rackspace is an example of an IaaS cloud provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is another one.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong>: PaaS provides a platform on which developers can build applications. Developers do not have to worry about infrastructure issues such as deploying servers or load balancing as is required
                  when using IaaS. Those aspects are automatically taken care of by the platform. The price to pay is reduced flexibility; applications written on PaaS are limited to facilities provided by the platform. A PaaS example is the Google App
                  Engine where developers can build applications using Java, Python, PHP, or Go whereas Amazon EC2 allows users to deploy application written in any language on their virtual servers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong>: This is when applications can be accessed over the network instead of installing them on a local machine. For example, Google Docs is an SaaS word processing software, while Microsoft Word
                  is a traditional word processing software.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
