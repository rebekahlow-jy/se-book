<Question has-input="true">

1.	Compare Software Engineering with Civil Engineering in terms of how work products in CE (i.e. buildings) differ from those of SE (i.e. software).
2.	Comment on this statement: Building software is cheaper and easier than building bridges (all we need is a PC!).
3.	Justify this statement: Coding is still a 'design' activity, not a 'manufacturing' activity.  You may use a comparison (or an analogy) of Software engineering versus Civil Engineering to prove this point.

(a)

| Buildings                                                                                                              | Software                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visible, tangible                                                                                                      | Invisible, intangible                                                                          |
| Wears out over time                                                                                                    | Does not wear out                                                                              |
| Change is limited by physical restrictions (e.g. difficult to remove a floor from a high rise building)                | Change is not limited by such restrictions. Just change the code and recompile.                |
| Creating an exact copy of a building is impossible. Creating a near copy is almost as costly as creating the original. | Any number of exact copies can be made with near zero cost.                                    |
| Difficult to move.                                                                                                     | Easily delivered from one place to another.                                                    |
| Many low-skilled workers following tried-and-tested procedures.                                                        | No low-skilled workers involved. Workers have more freedom to follow their own procedures.     |
| Easier to assure quality (just follow accepted procedure).                                                             | Not easy to assure quality.                                                                    |
| Majority of the work force has to be on location.                                                                      | Can be built by people who are not even in the same country.                                   |
| Raw materials are costly, costly equipment required.                                                                   | Almost free raw materials and relatively cheap equipment.                                      |
| Once construction is started, it is hard to do drastic changes to the design.                                          | Building process is very flexible. Drastic design changes can be done, although costly.        |
| A lot of manual and menial labor involved.                                                                             | Most work involves highly-skilled labor.                                                       |
| Generally robust. E.g. removing a single brick is unlikely to destroy a building.                                      | More fragile than buildings. A single misplaced semicolon can render the whole system useless. |

(b) Depends on the size of the software. Manpower required for software is very costly. On the other hand, we can create a very valuable software (e.g. an iPhone application that can make million dollars in a month) with a just a PC and a few days of work!

(c) Arguments to support this statement:

* If coding is a manufacturing activity, we should be able to do it using robotic machines (just like in the car industry) or low-skilled laborers (like in the construction industry).
* If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn't be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a 'design', yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.
* Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).

However, the type of 'design' that occurs during coding is at a much lower level than the 'design' that occurs before coding.
