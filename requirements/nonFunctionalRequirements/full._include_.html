    <p>There are two different kinds of requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Functional requirements</strong> specify what the system should do.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated. Some examples of non-functional requirements:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Data requirements e.g. size, volatility, persistency etc.,</li>
      <li>Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which system would operate or need to be compatible with.</li>
      <li>Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability,
        Security, Stability, Testability, and more…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-functional requirements are easier to miss. We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security
      is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionalities.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>[ ] a. The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>[ ] b. The application admin should be able to view a log of user activities.</li>
                <li>[ ] c. The source code should be open source.</li>
                <li>[ ] d. A course should be able to have up to 2000 students.</li>
                <li>[ ] e. As a student user, I can view details of my team members so that I can know who they are.</li>
                <li>[ ] f. The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are not IT-savvy.</li>
                <li>[ ] g. The product is offered as a free online service.</li>

                  <li>[x] a. The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.</li>
                  <li>[ ] b. The application admin should be able to view a log of user activities.</li>
                  <li>[x] c. The source code should be open source.</li>
                  <li>[x] d. A course should be able to have up to 2000 students.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Explanation: (b) are (e) are functionalities available for a specific user types. Therefore, they are functional requirements. (a), (c), (d), (f) and (g) are either constraints on functionality or constraints on how the project is done,
                  both of which are considered non-functional requirements.</p>
