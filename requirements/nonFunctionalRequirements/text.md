#### Non-Functional Requirements :one:

</div>

<div id="body">

There are two different kinds of requirements:  

1. **Functional requirements** specify what the system should do.
2. **Non-functional requirements** specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated. Some examples of non-functional requirements:
  * Data requirements e.g. size, volatility, persistency etc.,
  * Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which system would operate or need to be compatible with.
  * Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability, Security, Stability, Testability, and moreâ€¦

Non-functional requirements are easier to miss. We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionalities.
