## What are software requirements? 

<div id="main">

A requirement specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product. 

A software project may be,
* a _brown-field_ project: develop a product to replace/update an existing software product 
* a _green-field_ project: develop a totally new system with no precedent 

In either case, requirements have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, _scoped_. 

Requirements come from _stakeholders_. {more}
