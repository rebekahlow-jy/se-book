_Extensions_, given below the MSS, are "add-on"s to the MSS. They are also called _exceptional flow of events_ or _alternative flow of events_. They describe variations of the scenario that can happen if certain things are not as expected by the MSS. Extensions appear below the MSS. Note that the numbering style is not a rule but just a convention. The third extension, labeled as ‘\*a’ can happen at any step (hence, the ‘\*’).

When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the MSS should be self-contained. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario. Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.

<p/>

`<< extend >>` relationship between use cases is used to capture extensions to the use cases. Note how the arrow is pointing the other way.
