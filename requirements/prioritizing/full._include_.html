    <p>Short timelines and limited resources often mean that you cannot implement all requirements at once. A prioritization criterion can be used to gauge the importance and urgency of requirements from the user point of view, while keeping in mind the
      constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, and quality goals as seen by the development team.</p>
    <p>A common approach to prioritization is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled else it does not get user acceptance</li>
      <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
      <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
      <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the same time, some requirements may get discarded as they are considered ‘out of scope’.</p>
