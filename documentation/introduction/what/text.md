Developer-to-developer documentation can be in one of two forms:

1. Documentation for _developer-as-user_: Software components are written by developers and used by other developers. Therefore, there is a need to document how the components are to be used. API documents form the bulk of this category. Writing documentation of the first kind is easier because a component with a well-defined API exposes functionality in small-sized, independent and easy-to-use chunks. Examples of such documentation can be found in the [Java API](http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/).  

2. Documentation for _developer-as-maintainer_: There is a need to document how a system or a component is designed, implemented and tested so that other developers can maintain and evolve the code. Writing documentation of the second type is harder because of the need to explain complex internal details of a non-trivial system.
