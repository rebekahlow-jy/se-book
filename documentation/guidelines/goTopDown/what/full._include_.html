    <p>When writing project documents, a top-down breadth-first explanation is easier to understand than a bottom-up one. To explain a system called <em>SystemFoo</em> with two sub-systems, <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em>, start by describing the
      system at the highest level of abstraction, and progressively drill down to lower level details. An outline for such a description is given below.</p>
    <p>[First, explain what the system is, in a black-box fashion (no internal details, only the external view).]
      <em>SystemFoo</em> is a ....</p>
    <p>[Next, explain the high-level architecture of <em>SystemFoo</em>, referring to its major components only.]
      <em>SystemFoo</em> consists of two major components: <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em>. The job of <em>front-end</em> is to ... while the job of <em>back-end</em> is to ... And this is how <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em> work together
      ...</p>
    <p>[Now we can drill down to <em>front-end</em>'s details.]
      <em>front-end</em> consists of three major components: A, B, C A's job is to ... B's job is to... C's job is to... And this is how the three components work together ...</p>
    <p>[At this point, further drill down the internal workings of each component. A reader who is not interested in knowing nitty-gritty details can skip ahead to the section on <em>back-end</em>.] ...
    </p>
    <p>[At this point drill down details of the <em>back-end</em>.] ...
