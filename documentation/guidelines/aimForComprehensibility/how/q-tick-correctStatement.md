- [ ] b. to describe things in bottom-up breadth-first fashion.
- [x] c. to give a high priority to comprehension too, not stop at comprehensiveness only.

Explanation:

(a) Use diagrams when they help to understand the text descriptions. Text and diagrams should be used in tandem. Having separate sections for each diagram type is a sign of generating diagrams for the sake of having them.

(b) It should be in top-down breadth-first fashion

(c) Both are important, but lengthy, complete, accurate yet hard to understand documents are not that useful.
