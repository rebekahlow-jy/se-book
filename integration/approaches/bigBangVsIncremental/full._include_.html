    <p>In the <em>big-bang integration</em> approach, all components are integrated at the same time. This approach is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than
      when problems are uncovered incrementally.</p>

              <p>Give two arguments in support and two arguments against the following statement.</p>
              <p><em>Because there is no external client, it is OK to use big bang integration for a school project.</em></p>
              <div slot="answer">
                <p>Arguments for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is relatively simple; even big-bang can succeed.</li>
                  <li>Project duration is short; there is not enough time to integrate in steps.</li>
                  <li>The system is non-critical, non-production (demo only); the cost of integration issues is relatively small.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Arguments against:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inexperienced developers; big-bang more likely to fail</li>
                  <li>Too many problems may be discovered too late. Submission deadline (fixed) can be missed.</li>
                  <li>Team members have not worked together before; increases the probability of integration problems.</li>
