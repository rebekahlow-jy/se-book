              <p>In terms of timing and frequency, there are two general approaches to integration:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><em>Late and one-time</em>: In an extreme case of this approach, developers wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components just before the release. This approach is not recommended because integration often
                  causes many component incompatibilities (due to previous miscommunications and misunderstandings) to surface which can lead to delivery delays: Late integration -&gt; incompatibilities found -&gt; major rework required -&gt; cannot meet
                  the delivery date.</li>
                <li><em>Early and frequent</em>: The other approach is to integrate early and evolve in parallel in small steps, re-integrating frequently. For example, a working skeleton can be written first (i.e. it compiles and runs but does not produce
                  any useful output). This can be done by one developer, possibly the one in charge of integration. After that, all developers can flesh out the skeleton in parallel, adding one feature at a time. After each feature is done, simply integrate
                  the new code to the main system.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Whether using frequent integration or one-time late integration, there is still a need to decide the order in which components are to be integrated. There are several approaches to doing this, as explained next.</p>

              <p></p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Top-down</em> integration: In top-down integration, higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components. One advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early. One disadvantage
                  is that this requires the use of dummy or skeletal components (i.e. stubs) in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher-level components cannot function as they
                  depend on lower level ones.</li>
                <li><em>Bottom-up</em> integration: This is the reverse of top-down integration. Advantages and disadvantages are simply the reverse of those of the top-down approach.</li>
                <li><em>Sandwich</em> integration: This is a mix of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches. The idea is to do both top-down and bottom-up so as to ‚Äúmeet up‚Äù in the middle.</li>

                          <p>There can be many acceptable answers to this question. But any good strategy should consider at least some of the below.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Since <strong>HospitalUI</strong> will be developed early, it‚Äôs OK to integrate it early, using stubs, rather than wait for the rest of the system to finish. (i.e. a top-down integration is suitable for <strong>HospitalUI</strong>)</li>
                            <li>Because <strong>HospitalFacade</strong> is unlikely to have a lot of business logic, it may not be worth to write stubs to test it (i.e. a bottom-up integration is better for <strong>HospitalFacade</strong>).</li>
                            <li>Since <strong>IO_Helper</strong> is to be reused from an earlier project, we can finish it early. This is especially suitable since there are many classes that use it. Therefore <strong>IO_Helper</strong> can be integrated
                              with the dependent classes in bottom-up fashion.</li>
                            <li>Since <strong>OutPatient</strong> class may be delayed, we may have to integrate <strong>PatientMgr</strong> using a stub.</li>
                            <li><strong>TypeA</strong>, <strong>TypeB</strong>, and <strong>TypeC</strong> seem to be tightly coupled. It may be a good idea to test them together.</li>
                          </ul>

              <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically
                update release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build
                process can be done ‚Äòon demand‚Äô, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</p>
              <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‚Äòbuild‚Äô button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to
                this build process to some extent.</p>
              <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>
              <p>Build tool examples:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an
                important part of build automation. <em>Dependency Management</em> tools can automate that aspect of a project. Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p>
