        <p>In terms of timing and frequency, there are two general approaches to integration:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Late and one-time</em>: In an extreme case of this approach, developers wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components just before the release. This approach is not recommended because integration often causes
            many component incompatibilities (due to previous miscommunications and misunderstandings) to surface which can lead to delivery delays: Late integration -&gt; incompatibilities found -&gt; major rework required -&gt; cannot meet the delivery
            date.</li>
          <li><em>Early and frequent</em>: The other approach is to integrate early and evolve in parallel in small steps, re-integrating frequently. For example, a working skeleton can be written first (i.e. it compiles and runs but does not produce any
            useful output). This can be done by one developer, possibly the one in charge of integration. After that, all developers can flesh out the skeleton in parallel, adding one feature at a time. After each feature is done, simply integrate the
            new code to the main system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whether using frequent integration or one-time late integration, there is still a need to decide the order in which components are to be integrated. There are several approaches to doing this, as explained next.</p>

        <p>In the <em>big-bang integration</em> approach, all components are integrated at the same time. This approach is not recommended because it will uncover too many problems at the same time which could make debugging and bug-fixing more complex than
          when problems are uncovered incrementally.</p>

        <p>For incremental integration efforts, the following three incremental integration approaches are more suitable.</p><img src="/se-book/integration/approaches/topDownVsBottomUp/images/approaches.png" height="100">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Top-down</em> integration: In top-down integration, higher-level components are integrated before bringing in the lower-level components. One advantage of this approach is that higher-level problems can be discovered early. One disadvantage
            is that this requires the use of dummy or skeletal components (i.e. stubs) in place of lower level components until the real lower-level components are integrated to the system. Otherwise, higher-level components cannot function as they depend
            on lower level ones.</li>
          <li><em>Bottom-up</em> integration: This is the reverse of top-down integration. Advantages and disadvantages are simply the reverse of those of the top-down approach.</li>
          <li><em>Sandwich</em> integration: This is a mix of the top-down and the bottom-up approaches. The idea is to do both top-down and bottom-up so as to ‚Äúmeet up‚Äù in the middle.</li>

      <div>
        <p>In a non-trivial project, building a product from source code can be a complex multi-step process. For example, it can include steps such as to pull code from the revision control system, compile, link, run automated tests, automatically update
          release documents (e.g. build number), package into a distributable, push to repo, deploy to a server, delete temporary files created during building/testing, email developers of the new build, and so on. Furthermore, this build process can
          be done ‚Äòon demand‚Äô, it can be scheduled (e.g. every day at midnight) or it can be triggered by various events (e.g. triggered by a code push to the revision control system).</p>
        <p>Some of these build steps such as to compile, link and package are already automated in most modern IDEs. For example, several steps happen automatically when the ‚Äòbuild‚Äô button of the IDE is clicked. Some IDEs even allow customization to this
          build process to some extent.</p>
        <p>However, most big projects use specialized build tools to automate complex build processes.</p>
        <p>Build tool examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modern software projects often depend on third party libraries that evolve constantly. That means developers need to download the correct version of the required libraries and update them regularly. Therefore, dependency management is an important
          part of build automation. <em>Dependency Management</em> tools can automate that aspect of a project. Maven and Gradle, in addition to managing the build process, can play the role of dependency management tools too.</p>

        <p>An extreme application of build automation is called <em>continuous integration (CI)</em> in which integration, building, and testing happens automatically after each code change. A natural extension of CI is <em>Continuous Deployment (CD)</em>          where the changes are not only integrated continuously, but also deployed to end-users at the same time.</p>
