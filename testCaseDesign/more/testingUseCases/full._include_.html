    <p>Use case testing is straightforward in principle: test cases are simply based on the use cases. It is used for system testing (i.e. testing the system as a whole). For example, the main success scenario can be one test case while each variation (due
      to extensions) can form another test case. However, note that use cases do not specify the exact data entered into the system. Instead, it might say something like ‚Äúuser enters his personal data into the system‚Äù. Therefore, the tester has to choose
      data by considering equivalence partitions and boundary values. The combinations of these could result in one use case producing many test cases.</p>
    <p>To increase E&amp;E of testing, high-priority use cases are given more attention. For example, a scripted approach can be used to test high priority test cases, while an exploratory approach is used to test other areas of concern that could emerge
      during testing.</p>
