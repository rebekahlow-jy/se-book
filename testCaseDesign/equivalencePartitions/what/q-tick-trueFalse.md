<question>

Boundary value analysis recommends testing only values that reside on the equivalence class boundary.

- [ ] a. True
- [ ] b. False

<div slot="answer">

- [ ] a. True
- [x] b. False

Explanation: It does not recommend testing *only* those values *on* the boundary. It merely suggests that values on and around a boundary are more likely to cause errors.
