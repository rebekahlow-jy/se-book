</tip-box>

- [ ] a. null.
- [ ] b. strings having more than 50 characters.

<div slot="answer">

- [ ] a. null.
- [ ] b. strings having more than 50 characters.
- [ ] c. strings having 50 or fewer characters.
- [x] d. strings consisting of numbers instead of letters.

Explanation: The description does not mention anything about the content of the string. Therefore, the method is unlikely to behave differently for strings consisting of numbers.
