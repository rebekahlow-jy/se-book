    <p>In the context of testing, coverage is a metric used to measure the extent to which testing exercises the code.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Function/method coverage</strong> measures the coverage in terms of functions executed e.g. testing executed 90 out of 100 functions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Statement coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of the number of line of code executed e.g. testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decision/branch coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of decision points e.g. an if statement evaluated to both true and false with separate test cases during testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Condition coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage; e.g. if(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp;
          x &lt; 44) is considered one decision point but two conditions. For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == true : [e.g. x = 4]</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == false : [e.g. x = 100]</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required</p>
            <ul>
              <li>(x &gt; 2) == true , (x &lt; 44) == true : [e.g. x = 4]</li>
              <li>(x &lt; 44) == false : [e.g. x = 100]</li>
              <li>(x &gt; 2) == false : [e.g. x = 0]</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Path coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the <em>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</em>.
          For an introduction to CFGs, refer to the side-note below.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Entry/exit coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible <em>calls to</em> and <em>exits</em> from the operations in the SUT.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

                <p>Explanation: 100% path coverage implies all possible execution paths through the SUT have been tested. This is essentially ‘exhaustive testing’. While this is very hard to achieve for a non-trivial SUT, it technically gives us the highest
                  intensity of testing. If all tests pass at 100% path coverage, the SUT code can be considered ‘bug free’. However, note that path coverage does not include paths that are missing from the code altogether because the programmer left them
                  out by mistake.</p>
