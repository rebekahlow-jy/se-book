    <p>Measuring coverage is often done using <em>coverage analysis tools</em>. Coverage measurements are used to improve testing E&amp;E (Effectiveness and Efficiency). For example, if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test
      cases are added to cover missed branches.</p>
    <p>Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.</p>
