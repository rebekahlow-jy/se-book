Measuring coverage is often done using _coverage analysis tools_. Coverage measurements are used to improve testing E&E (Effectiveness and Efficiency). For example, if a set of test cases does not achieve 100% branch coverage, more test cases are added to cover missed branches.

Most IDEs have inbuilt support for measuring test coverage, or at least have plugins that can measure test coverage.
