Typically, tests are written after writing the SUT. However, TDD advocates writing the tests before writing the SUT. In other words, first define the precise behavior of the SUT using test cases, and then write the SUT to match the specified behavior. While TDD has its fair share of detractors, there are many who consider it a good way to reduce defects.
