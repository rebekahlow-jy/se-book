    <p><em>Dependency injection</em> is the process of ‘injecting’ objects to replace current dependencies with a different object. This is often used to inject stubs to isolate the SUT from other collaborating objects so that it can be tested independently.
      In the example below, a Foo object normally depends on a Bar object, but we have injected a BarStub object so that the Foo object no longer depends on a Bar object. Now we can test the Foo object in isolation from the Bar object.</p><img src="/se-book/testing/dependencyInjection/what/images/diagram.png"
