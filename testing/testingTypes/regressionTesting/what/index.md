#### What :one:

<div id="main">

When we modify a system that has been tested, the modification may result in some unintended and undesirable effects on the system. Such an effect is called a _regression_.

To detect and correct regressions, we need to retest all related components. Testing with this intent is called _regression testing_.

Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, regression testing is more practical when it is automated.
