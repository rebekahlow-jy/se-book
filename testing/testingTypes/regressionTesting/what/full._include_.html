    <p><strong>When we modify a system, the modification may result in some unintended and undesirable effects on the system. Such an effect is called a <em>regression</em>.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Regression testing</em> is re-testing the <trigger for="pop:sut">SUT</trigger> to detect regressions.</strong> Noted that to detect regressions, we need to retest all related components, even if they were tested before.</p>
    <p>Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, <strong>regression testing is more practical when it is automated</strong>.</p>
