    <p>Acceptance testing comes after system testing. Similar to system testing, acceptance testing involves testing the whole system.</p>
    <p>Some differences between system testing and acceptance testing:</p>

      <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
      <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements specification could be limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions while the system specification can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover,</li>
        <li>System specification could contain additional APIs not available for users (for the use of developers/testers), etc • Requirement specification could be written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to locate an email
          quickly) while the system specification could be written in terms of how the system solve those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</p>
      <p><strong>Importance of testing on the deployment environment</strong></p>
      <p>A system could work perfectly on the development environment, but fail in the deployment environment due to subtle differences between the two.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Explanation:</p>
                <p>System testing can aim for full coverage and can go beyond the system specification. Therefore, system testing is typically more extensive than acceptance testing.</p>
                <p>Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing. One reason for this is system tests are usually done on testbed environments while acceptance tests are usually done on the deployment environment. Another reason
                  is system testing is done against the system specification while acceptance tests can discover mismatches between system specification and user requirements (i.e. validation failures).</p>
