Explanation:

System testing can aim for full coverage and can go beyond the system specification. Therefore, system testing is typically more extensive than acceptance testing.

Passing system tests does not necessarily mean passing acceptance testing. One reason for this is system tests are usually done on testbed environments while acceptance tests are usually done on the
deployment environment. Another reason is system testing is done against the system specification while acceptance tests can discover mismatches between system specification and user requirements (i.e. validation failures).
