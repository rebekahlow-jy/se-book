_Acceptance testing_, also called _User Acceptance Testing (UAT)_, is a type of validation test carried out to show that the delivered system meets the requirements of the customer.

Acceptance tests give an assurance to the customer that the system does what it is intended to do. Acceptance test cases are often defined at the beginning of the project, usually based on the use case specification. Successful completion of UAT is often a prerequisite to the project signoff.
