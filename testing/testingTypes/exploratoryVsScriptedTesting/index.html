          <p>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Scripted testing: First write a set of test cases based on the system specification, perform the test cases.</li>
            <li>Exploratory testing: Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Exploratory testing is ‚Äòthe simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution‚Äô
            <trigger for="pop:bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>            because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>. Exploratory testing usually starts with areas
            identified as error-prone, based on the tester‚Äôs past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found. For example,</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>‚ÄúHmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature y works,
              even if x doesn‚Äôt work. Now, if feature y doesn‚Äôt work 100%, we have a major problem and this has to be made known to the development team sooner rather than later...‚Äù</p>

          <p>So which approach is better ‚Äì scripted or exploratory?</p>
          <p>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester‚Äôs prior experience and intuition. Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced
            testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means
            of testing a critical system.</p>
          <p>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations
              benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.</p>
