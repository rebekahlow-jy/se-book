            <p>At first it might seem logical to have the system built in its entirety first and then getting it tested by professional testers. Here are the downsides of that approach.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space; in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple inter-related
                bugs.</li>
              <li>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>
              <li>One bug might 'hide' other bugs, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
              <li>Too many bugs found during system testing can lead to delivery delays.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to the above reasons, it is better to do early developers testing. In fact, there is a widely accepted rule of thumb that says <em>the earlier a bug is found, the easier and cheaper to have it fixed</em>, as illustrated by the graph below.</p>

                      <p>Discuss advantages and disadvantages of developers testing their own code.</p>
                      <div slot="answer">
                        <p>Advantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Can be done early (the earlier we find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix).</li>
                          <li>Can be done at lower levels, for examples, at operation and class level (testers usually test the system at UI level).</li>
                          <li>It is possible to do more thorough testing since developers know the expected external behavior as well as the internal structure of the component.</li>
                          <li>It forces developers to take responsibility for their own work (they cannot claim that ‚Äútesting is the job of the testers‚Äù).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Disadvantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Developer may unconsciously test only situations that he knows to work (i.e. test it too ‚Äúgently‚Äù).</li>
                          <li>Developer may be blind to his own mistakes (if he did not consider a certain combination of input while writing code, he is likely to miss it again during testing).</li>
                          <li>Developer may have misunderstood what the SUT is supposed to do in the first place.</li>
                          <li>Developer may lack the testing expertise.</li>
                        </ul>
