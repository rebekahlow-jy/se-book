#### What :three:

<div id="main">

_Alpha testing_ is performed by the users, under controlled conditions set by the software development team.

_Beta testing_ is performed by a selected subset of target users of the system in their natural work setting.

An _open beta release_ is the release of not-yet-production-quality-but-almost-there software to the general population.  For example, Google’s Gmail was in ‘beta’ for many years before the label was finally removed.
