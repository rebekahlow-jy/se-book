                <p>During unit testing, stubs are used in place of collaborating objects in order to isolate the SUT from those objects. Doing so prevents bugs within the collaborating objects from interfering with the test.</p>
                <p><strong>A stub has the same interface as the collaborator it replaces, but its implementation is meant to be so simple that it cannot have any bugs. It mimics the responses of the collaborating object, but only for the inputs used for testing.</strong>                  That is, it does not know how to respond to any other inputs. These mimicked responses are hard-coded in the stub rather than computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. from a database.</p>

                <p>In <em>Integration testing</em> we test whether different parts of the software ‘work together’ (i.e. integrates) as expected. Here, we assume the individual parts have been unit tested already. Therefore, integration tests aim to discover
                  bugs in the ‘glue code’ that are often the result of misunderstanding of what the parts are supposed to do vs what the parts are actually doing. For example let us assume a class <code>Car</code> users classes <code>Engine</code> and
                  <code>Wheel</code>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First, we should unit test <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
                  <li>Next, we should unit test <code>Car</code> in isolation of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>, using stubs for <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
                  <li>After that, we can do an integration test for <code>Car</code> using it together with the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Wheel</code> classes to ensure the <code>Car</code> integrates properly with the <code>Engine</code> and the <code>Wheel</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the example above, if the <code>Car</code> class assumed a <code>Wheel</code> can support 200 mph speed but the <code>Wheel</code> can only support 150 mph, it is the integration test that is supposed to uncover this discrepancy.</p>

                <p>In system testing we take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</p>
                <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
                <p>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system. Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails ‘gracefully’ having pushed beyond
                  its limits.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>Take the example of an SUT (software under test) that is a browser capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. A test case can involve loading a web page containing more than 5000 characters. The expected ‘graceful’
                    behavior would be to ‘abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message’. This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
                </tip-box>
                <p>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too. Here are some examples.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Performance testing</em> – to ensure the system responds quickly.</li>
                  <li><em>Load testing</em> (also called <em>stress testing</em> or <em>scalability testing</em>) – to ensure the system can work under heavy load.</li>
                  <li><em>Security testing</em> – to test how secure the system is.</li>
                  <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> – to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>
                  <li><em>Usability testing</em> – to test how easy it is to use the system.</li>
                  <li><em>Portability testing</em> – to test whether the system works on different platforms.</li>

                <p>At first it might seem logical to have the system built in its entirety first and then getting it tested by professional testers. Here are the downsides of that approach.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Locating the cause of such a test case failure is difficult due to a large search space; in a large system, the search space could be millions of lines of code, written by hundreds of developers! The failure may also be due to multiple
                    inter-related bugs.</li>
                  <li>Fixing a bug found during such testing could result in major rework, especially if the bug originated during the design or during requirements specification (i.e. a faulty design or faulty requirements).</li>
                  <li>One bug might 'hide' other bugs, which could emerge only after the first bug is fixed.</li>
                  <li>Too many bugs found during system testing can lead to delivery delays.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Due to the above reasons, it is better to do early developers testing. In fact, there is a widely accepted rule of thumb that says <em>the earlier a bug is found, the easier and cheaper to have it fixed</em>, as illustrated by the graph

                <p>Here are two alternative approaches to testing a software.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Scripted testing: First write a set of test cases based on the system specification, perform the test cases.</li>
                  <li>Exploratory testing: Devise test cases on-the-fly, creating new test cases based on the results of the past test cases.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Exploratory testing is ‘the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution’
                  <trigger for="pop:bach-et-explained">[source: bach-et-explained]</trigger> whereby the nature of the follow-up test case is decided based on the behavior of the previous test cases. In other words, running the system and trying out various operations. It is called <em>exploratory testing</em>                  because testing is driven by observations during testing. Exploratory testing is also known as <em>reactive testing, error guessing technique, attack-based testing,</em> and <em>bug hunting</em>. Exploratory testing usually starts with
                  areas identified as error-prone, based on the tester’s past experience with similar systems. One tends to conduct more tests for those operations where more faults are found. For example,</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>“Hmm... looks like feature x is broken. This usually means feature n and k could be broken too; we need to look at them soon. But before that, let us give a good test run to feature y because users can still use the product if feature

                <p>So which approach is better – scripted or exploratory?</p>
                <p>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition. Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled or inexperienced
                  testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole
                  means of testing a critical system.</p>
                <p>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar systems.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations
                    benefit from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches.</p>

                  <p><strong>Requirement Specification vs System Specification</strong></p>
                  <p>The requirement specification need not be the same as the system specification. Some example differences:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Requirements specification could be limited to how the system behaves in normal working conditions while the system specification can also include details on how it will fail gracefully when pushed beyond limits, how to recover,</li>
                    <li>System specification could contain additional APIs not available for users (for the use of developers/testers), etc • Requirement specification could be written in terms of problems that need to be solved (e.g. provide a method to
                      locate an email quickly) while the system specification could be written in terms of how the system solve those problems (e.g. explain the email search feature).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>However, in many cases one document serves as both a requirement specification and a system specification.</p>
                  <p><strong>Importance of testing on the deployment environment</strong></p>
                  <p>A system could work perfectly on the development environment, but fail in the deployment environment due to subtle differences between the two.</p>

                  <p>To detect and correct regressions, we need to retest all related components. Testing with this intent is called <em>regression testing</em>.</p>
                  <p>Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, regression testing is more practical when it is automated.</p>
