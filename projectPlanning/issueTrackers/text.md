Issue trackers (sometimes called bug trackers) are commonly used to track task assignment and progress. E.g. Bugzilla. Most online project management software such as GoogleCode, GitHub, SourceForge and BitBucket come with an integrated issue tracker. The following is a screenshot from the Jira Issue tracker software.

Issue trackers can also be used as _task trackers_, i.e. to define tasks to be done, to track who is doing what, and the status of each task.

More elaborate tools for scheduling and tracking projects include PERT chars and Gantt charts.
