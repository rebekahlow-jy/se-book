_Logging_ can be useful for troubleshooting problems the error handling code could not prevent (due to the failure to cater for certain situations).

A good logging system records some system information regularly. When bad things happen to a system, their associated log files may provide indications of what went wrong and action can then be taken to prevent it from happening again. This is the same reason why airplanes have ‘black boxes’.
