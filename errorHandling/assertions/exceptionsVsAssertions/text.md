#### Exceptions vs Assertions :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

Exceptions and assertions are two complementary ways of handling errors in software but they serve different purposes.

* The raising of an exception indicates an unusual condition created by the user (e.g.  user inputs an unacceptable input) or the environment (e.g., a file needed for the program is missing).
* An assertion failure indicates the programmer made a mistake in the code (e.g., a null value is returned from a method that is not supposed to return null under any circumstances).

Both assertions and exceptions should be used in code.
