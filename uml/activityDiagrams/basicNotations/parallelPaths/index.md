#### Parallel Paths :two:

<div id="main">

_Forks_ and _joins_ have the same notation: a **bar**. They indicate the start and end of concurrent flows of control. The following diagram shows an example of their use. For _join_, execution along all incoming control flows should be complete before the execution starts on the outgoing control flow.
