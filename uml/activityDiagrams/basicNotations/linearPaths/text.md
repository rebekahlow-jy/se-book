An activity diagram (AD) consists of a sequence of actions and control flows. An _action_ is a single step in an activity. It is shown as a rectangle with **rounded** edges. A control flow shows the flow of control from one action to the next. It is shown by drawing a line with an arrow-head to show the direction of the flow.
