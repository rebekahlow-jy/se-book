    <p>An activity diagram (AD) consists of a sequence of actions and control flows. An <em>action</em> is a single step in an activity. It is shown as a rectangle with <strong>rounded</strong> edges. A control flow shows the flow of control from one action
      to the next. It is shown by drawing a line with an arrow-head to show the direction of the flow.</p><img src="/se-book/uml/activityDiagrams/basicNotations/linearPaths/images/diagram.png" height="230">
