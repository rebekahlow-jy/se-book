#### Multiplicity :two:

</div>

<div id="body">

A class diagram can also indicate the _multiplicity_ of an association. Multiplicity is the number of objects of a class that participate in the association.

Commonly used multiplicities:
*	0..1 : optional, can be linked to 0 or 1 objects
*	1 : compulsory, must be linked to one object at all times.
*	* : can be linked to 0 or more objects.
*	n..m : the number of linked objects must be n to m inclusive

<tip-box>

In the diagram below, an Admin object administers (in charge of) any number of students but a Student object must always be under the charge of exactly one Admin object

<p/>

Example:
*	Each Student must be supervised by a Professor.
*	Students have matriculation numbers.  A Professor cannot supervise more than 5 students.
*	Admin staff handles Professors as well.
