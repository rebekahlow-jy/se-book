**A _model_ is anything used in any way to represent anything else.** For example, a class diagram is a model that represents a software design and is drawn using the UML modeling notation.

**A _model_ provides a simpler view of a complex entity because a model captures only a selected aspect.** For example, a class diagram captures the class structure of the software design but not the runtime behavior.

**Multiple models of the same entity may be needed to capture it fully.** For example, in addition to the class diagram, a number of sequence diagrams may need to be created to capture various interesting interaction scenarios the software undergoes.
