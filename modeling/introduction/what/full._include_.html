    <p><strong>A <em>model</em> is anything used in any way to represent anything else.</strong> For example, a class diagram is a model that represents a software design and is drawn using the UML modeling notation.</p>
    <p><strong>A <em>model</em> provides a simpler view of a complex entity because a model captures only a selected aspect.</strong> For example, a class diagram captures the class structure of the software design but not the runtime behavior.</p>
    <p><strong>Multiple models of the same entity may be needed to capture it fully.</strong> For example, in addition to the class diagram, a number of sequence diagrams may need to be created to capture various interesting interaction scenarios the software
      undergoes.</p>
