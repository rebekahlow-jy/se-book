          <p>The analysis process for identifying objects and object classes is recognized as one of the most difficult areas of object-oriented development.</p>
          <p>--Ian Sommerville, in the book ‚ÄòSoftware Engineering‚Äô</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the problem domain (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). When used to model the problem domain, such class diagrams are called
          <strong><em>conceptual class diagrams</em></strong> or <strong><em>OO domain models (OODMs).</em></strong></p>
        <tip-box>
          <p>Example: OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
          <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of
            squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player‚Äôs piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake‚Äôs tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically
            move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p><img src="/se-book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png" height="420">
          <p></p>
          <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
        </tip-box>
        <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not
          usually in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
        <p><strong>OODMs, just like a class diagram, represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem</strong> domain and not their behavior. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
        <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>
