Professional software engineers rarely use notepad-like text editors for writing code. Instead, they use more sophisticated tools called _Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)_. The aim of an IDE is to support all development-related work within the same tool environment.

An IDE generally consists of:

*	A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.
*	A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.
*	A debugger that allows program errors to be located.
*	Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, and modeling support.

Note:

Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) over heavier IDEs.
