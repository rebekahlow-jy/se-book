**Professional software engineers often write code using _Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)_. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.**

An IDE generally consists of:

*  A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.
*  A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.
*  A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.
*  Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.

Examples of popular IDEs: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans, Visual Studio, DevC++, DrJava, XCode

Note: Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) over heavier IDEs.
