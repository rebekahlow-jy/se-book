    <p>Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting. A group of people (e.g. potential users, beta testers) are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process. Focus groups can bring out undiscovered
      conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be resolved or clarified as necessary.</p>
